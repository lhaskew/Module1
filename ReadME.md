# Overview

The data set that I am analyzing is the stock market trends for Microsoft over the last year. I pulled this data set from NASDAQ. This is linked below.

My purpose for writing this software is to provide the user with an easier interface to interact with a data set without having to manually.

# Data Analysis Results

The questions I had regarding this data set had to do with finding the average of the dataset as well as the range difference from a specified date range in the dataset. Through user input, you are able to see any of these by simply inputting your date range. 

# Development Environment

The tool that I used to develop this software is VS Code.

I used Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Python to create my code as well as my visuals.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add better visualizations for the average data.
* Create additional visualizations to be able to add multiple visuals on top of each other.
* Add further rules to make sure all variables are accounted for when pulling the range and average functions.
